# Kaggle - Titanic

For this competition, I have decided to try an Ensemble Stacking method. 

The base classifiers that I have used are Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees and Support Vector Classifier from sklearn.

The second classifier that I used is the XGBoost Classifier. 

I have included implementations of just the base classifiers as well. The ensemble technique has been applied with and without feature engineering.
